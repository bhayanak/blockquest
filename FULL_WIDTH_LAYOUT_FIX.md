# Full Width Layout Fix - September 17, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### ðŸŽ¯ **1. Main Menu Full Width Layout**
**Problem**: Buttons were centered with too much left/right space wasted on mobile
**Solution Applied:**
- **Removed centering calculation**: Replaced centered grid positioning with left-aligned layout
- **Full width button spacing**: Buttons now use `(availableWidth - maxButtonWidth) / (cols - 1)` to fill entire width
- **Left-aligned start position**: `startX = sidePadding + maxButtonWidth / 2` instead of centered calculation
- **Wider START button**: Increased from 60%/70% to 90%/90% of screen width on mobile

**Result:** 
- âœ… Buttons now span the full screen width
- âœ… No wasted left/right margins
- âœ… Much larger touch targets on mobile
- âœ… START button uses 90% of screen width

### ðŸŽ¯ **2. Game Screen - Proper Icon and Button Positioning**
**Problem**: Speaker/coin icons were at far right edge, power-up buttons positioned incorrectly
**Solution Applied:**

#### **Speaker & Coin Icons:**
- **Positioned near grid**: `gridRightEdge + 40px` instead of screen edge
- **Grid-relative positioning**: Icons now follow grid position, not screen edge
- **Proper spacing**: `Math.min(width - 20, gridRightEdge + 40)` ensures they stay near grid

#### **Power-up Buttons (Row, Swap, Undo):**
- **Restored proper panel**: Power-up panel now positioned `gridRightEdge + 65/80px`
- **Correct panel size**: Increased back to 120/140px width, 140px height
- **Better vertical position**: `gridOrigin.y + 80/60px` - closer to grid top
- **Proper button spacing**: `yStep = 35px` for comfortable touch targets
- **All 3 buttons visible**: Row, Swap, Undo buttons are all present and functional

**Result:**
- âœ… Speaker/coin icons positioned near grid (not far right)
- âœ… Power-up buttons (Row, Swap, Undo) are visible and close to grid
- âœ… Compact layout with no wasted space
- âœ… All UI elements positioned relative to grid, not screen edges
